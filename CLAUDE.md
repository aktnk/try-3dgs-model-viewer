### What is 3D Gaussian Splatting?

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a novel 3D scene representation technique that uses 3D Gaussians to represent scenes. It enables high-quality real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes captured from photographs. This project aims to provide an interactive viewer for such models.
